A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I have used these packages in this project
firebase_core: ^3.4.1
cloud_firestore: ^5.4.1
google_sign_in: ^6.2.1
firebase_auth: ^5.2.1

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
